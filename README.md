# Tasks 4 and 5 - EN-TEx ATAC-seq Data: Downstream Analyses

Tasks 4 and 5 focus on the analysis of ATAC-seq data from the EN-TEx project, specifically for stomach and sigmoid colon tissues. These tasks include the steps required to retrieve, process, and analyze ATAC-seq peaks, as well as to perform intersection analysis using BEDTools to identify regulatory elements associated with gene bodies and promoter regions.
