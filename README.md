Tasks 4 and 5 focus on the analysis of ATAC-seq data from the EN-TEx project for stomach and sigmoid colon tissues. These tasks include steps to retrieve, process, and analyze ATAC-seq peaks, as well as to perform intersection analysis using BEDTools in order to identify regulatory elements associated with gene bodies and promoter regions.

For detailed pipeline instructions, code snippets, and expected results, please refer to the Wiki section of this repository. The Wiki provides a comprehensive guide covering all aspects of the analysis workflow.
